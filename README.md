### Python Bot Automated Rejection Mail
In this example script, the idea is create a bot in Python to send automated gentle rejection messages to candidates during a recruiting process after a certain period of inactivity by the recruiter.
Can be achieved using various libraries and tools. In this example, I'll demonstrate a simple Python script that sends rejection emails using the smtplib library.

_Note that you'll need access to an email server or service to send emails._

First, make sure you have Python installed on your system.
```
# Check the Python 3 version
$ python3 --version
```
Otherwise, you can install with the following command lines as well:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install python3.8 python3-pip
```

In this script:

Replace the **SMTP_SERVER** , **SMTP_PORT**, **SMTP_USERNAME**, and **SMTP_PASSWORD** variables with your email server settings.
Define the email subject and content for the rejection email in **EMAIL_SUBJECT** and **EMAIL_CONTENT**.

Populate the candidates dictionary with candidate email addresses and their last interaction timestamps. Adjust the timestamps as needed.
The script iterates through the candidates and sends rejection emails if the candidate has been inactive for 5 days or more.
Make sure to enable access to less secure apps or generate an app-specific password for your email account if required by your email service provider. Additionally, you may need to adjust the email content and formatting according to your needs and preferences.
